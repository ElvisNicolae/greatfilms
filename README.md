The website's main purpose is to help users find great movies to watch. Users can rate those movies and create lists with them in order to keep track of the movies they've watched, to put them in certain categories or to simply create a watchlist. It's a website similar to IMDb and MyAnimeList.

It is built with React ES6+, Redux and Sass, and uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API and the IMDb-API (for movie trailers).

Logged in users can do all of the following things:
- Search for a movie
- Explore:
  - top rated movies
  - trending movies
  - upcoming movies
  - popular actors on the website
- See details of a movie
- Watch the trailer of a movie
- Get recommendations based on that movie
- Rate a particular movie (and change or delete that rating )
- Add movies to the watchlist
- Create custom lists
  - Delete those lists
  - Add movies to those lists
  - Remove movies from those lists
- See details of an actor and the movies they played in



To improve the performance of the website, lazy loading technique was used; and to make the project more scalable, the components were built to be as reusable as possible.

The BEM methodology was used as a naming convention for classes.
